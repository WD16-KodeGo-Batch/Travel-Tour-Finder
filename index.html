                      <p><em>When you think of Bolinao in Pangasinan, the first thing that comes to mind is the Patar White Beach, a pristine coast with creamy white sand that is compared to the likes of Boracay and El Nido. But Bolinao has a lot more to offer for those who dare to explore.
                        <br><br>
                        Head to the forest side of the place and you’ll find the gem that is Bolinao Falls, a mesmerizing waterfall tucked inside a quiet community. It deserves a spot on your bucket list!
                        It’s divided into three waterfalls, all located along the beautiful Bolinao river. Each fall has different views and features, and you can choose to explore just one. But of course, we recommend that you try all three!</em></p>

A popular tourist spot, it is renowned for its "perfect cone" because of its symmetric conical shape, and is regarded as very sacred in Philippine mythology. The volcano with its surrounding landscape was declared a national park on July 20, 1938, the first in the nation. It was reclassified as a natural park and renamed the Mayon Volcano Natural Park in 2000. It is the centerpiece of the Albay Biosphere Reserve, declared by UNESCO in 2016, and is currently being nominated as a World Heritage Site. Mayon is the most active volcano in the Philippines, and its activity is regularly monitored by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology from their provincial headquarters on Ligñon Hill, about 12 kilometers from the summit.</em></p>

                      Tinuy-an Falls is a multi-tiered waterfall in Bislig, Surigao del Sur in the southern island of Mindanao, Philippines.[1] Bislig is a city known as the Booming City by the Bay. The waterfall itself has been featured in various international travel magazines and TV shows. <br><br>
                      The Tinuy-an falls are 95 m wide and 55 metres (180 ft) high, touted as the little Niagara Falls of the Philippines. Tinuy-an is a white water curtain that flows in three levels (with a fourth tier hidden from view) and is said to be the widest waterfall in the Philippines. Every morning, the area shows a rainbow between 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. One may also ride a raft to get close to its cascades and get a water “massage.”

Prior to the artistic sculpting, the limestone was prepared by a group of engineers and miners, then the "actual artistic carving of the façade" made by the late sculptor Anselmo B. Day-ag. The construction project began in 1968 but was interrupted. The project was continued in 1971 by another Lions Club president, Robert Webber,and was unveiled in 1972.</em></p>

                      <h3>Nacpan Beach</h3>
                      <p><em>Nacpan Beach is considered the best not only in El Nido, but throughout the Palawan. This is a very picturesque and deserted, but at the same time well-equipped beach, which seems endless. <br><br>

                        A wide and extended (4100 m) strip of white sand is washed by bright blue waves of clear and clear sea water. Nacpan beach is located in a large secluded bay of the island, surrounded by green hills. A palm grove stretches parallel to the shore, so on the beach you can sit in natural shade. There are waves on Nacpan, but they do not interfere with swimming. The bottom is sand, without stones and corals. The entry into the water is comfortable and smooth, the shallow water is quite long, so the beach is great for families with kids.
